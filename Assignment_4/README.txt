This folder contains the verilog code for 3-bit gray code counter and 8-bit adder subtractor circuits. 

After extracting this folder, open the folder in any suitable editor (supporting verilog) or terminal. Navigate to
the subfolder containing the verilog code to be tested and write the following lines in the terminal:

iverilog -o <name of test bench file>.vvp <name of test bench file>.v

vvp <name of test bench file>.vvp


The outputs will be displayed after successful execution of these two instructions.
