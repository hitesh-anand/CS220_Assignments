This folder contains verilog codes for 1010-Sequence Detector and 3-bit odd parity generator. The "Report.pdf" file contains
the details of FSM constructions used in this assignment.

The report includes state diagrams, excitation table, transition and output table, and state table for the FSM constructions. It also includes
some implementation details and assumptions made while implementing the code.


To run the files, open the terminal and write the following two commands:

>> iverilog -o <name of the test bench file>.vvp <name of the test bench file>.v

>> vvp <name of the test bench file>.vvp

The output will then be displayed in the terminal.
