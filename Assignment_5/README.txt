The folder contains of 6 files :

1. "gcd.v" and "gcd_tb.v" for Q1
2. insertion_sort.s for Q2
3. fibonacci.s for Q3
4. alt_product.s for Q4

NOTE : All the spim files contain some test cases and their outputs.


Q1 : 

On execution of gcd_tb.v(the test bench file), the output is displayed in the gcd format. Inputs a
and b are given in the test bench file itself. 15 different inputs have been given with a time-delay 
such that it is convenient with the clk period and the gcd value gets stabilized before we take the
next input.


Q2 :

A prompt asks for 10 integers. The final output is a sorted array which ocntains the input elements in a sorted
order.

Q3 : 

The output contains the fibonacci series < 500.

Q4 :

The prompt asks for the value of n. Then, it asks for n floating point numbers. The final output is then displayed
in the console.
